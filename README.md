# Overview
The software demonstrates the use of Kotlin in an Android environment, utilizing Android Studio. The goal of the project was to "get a feel" for Kotlin and the Android platform, as creating a CLI with Kotlin didnâ€™t seem interesting.

As it turned out, Android development requires far more skills and the use of various tools than I initially thought. What should have been a simple app to create a book list, allowing users to add and delete entries, took a considerable amount of time, even when following a tutorial.

Nonetheless, I now know much more than I did before. It's also worth noting that I had no prior experience with either Android Studio or Kotlin before starting this project.
